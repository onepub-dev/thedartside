# About me

I'm an opinionated git, who tries not to take myself too seriously, so neither should you.

Brett \(that's me\) started out as a C programmer building console apps on Unix then moved to building GUI apps on Windows in C and C++.

With the advent of the Web, Brett moved to building Java web applications.

In between all of that, Brett has programmed commercially in over a dozen languages on a variety of OSs.

Brett's hobbies are hacking, wood working, renovating, CAD and blowing things up.

Brett started working with Dart somewhere in 2018 and is the developer behind numerous Dart packages including:

* [DCli](https://pub.dev/packages/dcli)
* [pub\_release](https://pub.dev/packages/pub_release)
